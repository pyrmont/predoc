Predoc is a Markdown flavour specifically designed for writing man pages.

> [!WARNING]
> Predoc is in a beta stage of development. There are likely to be bugs and

This is the repository for the reference implementation of the parser and
renderer written in the Janet programming language. It includes a command-line
utility, `predoc`, which converts a Predoc document into a man page written in
mdoc.

You can try out Predoc in your browser on the [project homepage][ph].

NAME
====

**predoc** - converter from Predoc to mdoc

SYNOPSIS
========

**predoc** [**--format** _fmt_] [**--name** _program_] [**--no-ad**]
           [**--output** _path_] _input_

DESCRIPTION
===========

**predoc** is a command-line tool for converting documents written in
`predoc(7)` to man pages written in `mdoc(7)`.
```

and convert it to this:

```mdoc
.\"

which in turn is rendered by `man` into this:

## Language

### Rationale

Documentation is great and man pages can be a wonderful source of information.
But people are discouraged from creating or updating man pages because the syntax
of mdoc and roff (the markup languages used for these documents) is
intimidating.

Predoc aims to remedy this. Markdown allows a person to create HTML that 'looks
like' what they wrote. Predoc wants to do the same thing for man pages: create
mdoc that 'looks like' what is written in plain text.

### Syntax

Like Markdown, Predoc is a lightweight markup language that optimises for
ease-of-reading and ease-of-writing. It does this by specifying its syntactic
constructs using punctuation characters.

More information about the Predoc language is in `predoc(7)`. You can
(hopefully) see the benefit of writing man pages in Predoc by reading the
[Predoc version][predoc-syntax] directly.

## CLI Utility

### Building

#### Pre-Built

Pre-built binaries of `predoc` are available as tarballs via the
[Releases][github-releases] section on GitHub for:

- FreeBSD 14 (x86-64 and aarch64)
- Linux (x86-64 and aarch64)
- macOS (aarch64)

[github-releases]: https://github.com/pyrmont/predoc/releases

```console
$ curl -LO https://github.com/pyrmont/predoc/releases/latest/download/predoc-<version>-<platform>-<arch>.tar.gz
$ tar -xzf predoc-<version>-<platform>-<arch>.tar.gz
$ cd predoc-<version>
```

#### From Source

To build the `predoc` binary from source, you need [Janet][janet-hp] installed
on your system together with a build tool that can create 'quickbin'
executables. Janet officially supports Linux, macOS, Windows and various BSDs.
For the build tool, I suggest [Jeep][jeep-hp].

[janet-hp]: https://janet-lang.org/

[jeep-hp]: https://github.com/pyrmont/jeep

Once Janet and Jeep are installed, run:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/pyrmont/predoc
$ cd predoc
$ git tag --sort=creatordate
$ git checkout <version>
$ jeep install
```

### Installing

Move the `predoc` binary somewhere on your path and `predoc.1` and `predoc.7` to
the appropriate man page locations. For example:

```console
# use sudo or doas depending on the permissions of the target directories
$ sudo cp predoc /usr/local/bin/
$ sudo cp predoc.1 /usr/local/share/man/man1/
$ sudo cp predoc.7 /usr/local/share/man/man7/
```

### Using

To convert a Predoc document called `example.1.predoc` into the man page
`example.1` for the program `example`, you can write:

```
$ predoc example.1.predoc
```

If only the input filename is given, `predoc` will use this to derive the
program name and the output filename.

To specify these values explicitly, you can write:

```
$ predoc --name example --output example.1 example.1.predoc
```

More information about `predoc` is, of course, available in `predoc(1)`.

## Alternatives

There are alternatives to Predoc. Here are a few:

- **[lowdown][]** is a simple Markdown translator. It is written in C and
  compiles to a single binary with no dependencies. It uses Markdown. It
  produces roff rather than mdoc but can convert to additional formats as well.
  The syntactic constructs it can produce in the generated man page are fewer
  than can be produced by Predoc. It is _actively_ maintained.

- **[Pandoc][]** is the universal document converter. It is written in Haskell
  and compiles to a single binary with no dependencies. It uses Markdown. It
  produces roff rather than mdoc but can convert to additional formats as well.
  The syntactic constructs it can produce in the generated man page are fewer
  than can be produced by Predoc. It is _actively_ maintained.

- **[ronn][]** is the opposite of roff. It is written in Ruby and runs as an
  executable script that requires Ruby. It uses a syntax similar to Markdown.
  It produces roff rather than mdoc but can also produce HTML. The syntactic
  constructs it can produce in the generated man page are fewer than can be
  produced by Predoc. It is _not actively_ maintained. (It does objectively have
  the best name.)

- **[scdoc][]** is a simple man page generator. It is written in C and compiles
  to a single binary with no dependencies. It uses a syntax similar to Markdown.
  It produces roff rather than mdoc. The syntactic constructs it can produce in
  the generated man page are fewer than can be produced by Predoc. It is
  _actively_ maintained.

## Versioning

Predoc uses the label `DEVEL` during development. When a new version is
released, a tag is created for that version in the repository.
