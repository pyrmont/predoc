.Sh NAME
.Nm rmdir
.Nd remove directories
.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Oo
.Fl pv
.Oc
.Ar \&directory 
.No ...
.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The 
.Nm
utility removes the directory entry specified by each 
.Ar \&directory
argument,
provided it is empty.
.Pp
Arguments are processed in the order given.
In order to remove both a parent directory and a subdirectory of that parent,
the subdirectory must be specified first so the parent directory is empty when 
.Nm
tries to remove it.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo 
.Fl p
.Xc
Each 
.Ar \&directory
argument is treated as a pathname of which all components will be removed,
if they are empty,
starting with the last most component.
(See 
.Xr rm 1\&
for fully non-discriminant recursive removal.)
.It Xo 
.Fl v
.Xc
Be verbose,
listing each directory as it is removed.
.El
.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The 
.Nm
utility exits with one of the following values:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo 0
.Xc
Each directory entry specified by a 
.Ar \&directory
operand referred to an empty directory and was removed successfully.
.It Xo >0
.Xc
An error occurred.
.El
.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Remove the directory 
.Ar \&foobar ,
if it is empty:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ rmdir foobar
.Ed
.Pp
Remove all directories up to and including 
.Ar \&cow ,
stopping at the first non-empty directory (if any):
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ rmdir -p cow/horse/monkey
.Ed
.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr rm 1\&
.
.Sh STANDARDS
The 
.Nm
utility is expected to be IEEE Std 1003.2 (“POSIX.2”)
compatible.
.
.Sh HISTORY
A 
.Nm
command appeared in Version 1 AT&T UNIX.
