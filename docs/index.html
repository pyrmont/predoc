<h1 id="predoc">Predoc</h1>
<p>The <strong>Predoc</strong> language is a Markdown flavour for
writing manpages.</p>
<p>Using Predoc, you can quickly and easily add documentation to your
project. Your users can then consult this documentation in the comfort
of their own terminal using standard tools like <strong>man</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>The reference implementation for Predoc is written in the <a
href="https://janet-lang.org">Janet</a> programming language. Janet is a
Lisp that comes with a powerful PEG (parser expression grammar) engine
as part of the runtime.</p>
<p>The reference implementation includes a single-binary command-line
utility that you can use to convert Predoc into mdoc. <a
href="https://github.com/pyrmont/predoc/releases">Pre-built binaries</a>
are available for FreeBSD, Linux and macOS from the repository on
GitHub.</p>
<h2 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h2>
<p>Markdown is a lightweight markup language that optimises for
ease-of-reading and ease-of-writing. As explained on the <a
href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown">Markdown project
website</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Readability is emphasised above all else. A Markdown-formatted
document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking
like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Predoc shares this philosophy. Its syntax is comprised of punctuation
characters. As much as possible, the punctuation characters are chosen
to look like what they mean. Headings look like headings, emphasis looks
like emphasis, lists look like lists and so on.</p>
<p>Markdown assumes that it will be converted to HTML. Predoc assumes
that it will be converted to <a
href="https://mandoc.bsd.lv/man/mdoc.7.html">mdoc</a>. In the same way
that Markdown is not a replacement for HTML, predoc is not a replacement
for mdoc. John Gruber, the creator of Markdown, makes a distinction
between HTML as a publishing format and Markdown as a writing format.
Predoc makes this same distinction: mdoc is a publishing format and
predoc is a writing format.</p>
<h2 id="syntax">Syntax</h2>
<p>Predoc’s syntax is a reduced and modified set of Markdown’s
syntax.The Predoc syntax is more fully described in the <a
href="https://github.com/pyrmont/predoc/blob/master/predoc.7.predoc"><code>predoc(7)</code></a>
manpage.</p>
<p>To give you an idea, here are a couple of syntactic elements that
make writing manpages in Predoc such a nice experience:</p>
<h3 id="commands">Commands</h3>
<p>A command is denoted by <code>**</code> on either side of text.</p>
<pre class="predoc"><code>Load the **jump** program.</code></pre>
<p>Commands are intended to be used for internal or interactive commands
associated with the subject of the manpage. For strong text, use
<code>__</code> instead.</p>
<p>When rendered to mdoc, a command usually produces an internal command
using the <code>Ic</code> macro. The exception to this is when a name is
provided to the rendering function. In this case, a command produces the
name of the manpage using the <code>Nm</code> macro.</p>
<h3 id="options">Options</h3>
<p>An option is denoted by <code>**</code> on either side of text. The
option name must begin with <code>-</code>. Long options begin with
<code>--</code>.</p>
<pre class="predoc"><code>If flying is enabled, use **-f** or **--fly**.</code></pre>
<p>Options are intended to be used for what mdoc calls command-line
flags or command-line options. For strong text, use <code>__</code>
instead.</p>
<p>When rendered to mdoc, an option produces a command option using the
<code>Op</code> macro.</p>
<h3 id="tagged-lists">Tagged Lists</h3>
<p>A tagged list is denoted by a <code>-</code> at the start of the
first line, a <code>:</code> at the end of the first line and then a
body beginning on the second line.</p>
<pre class="predoc"><code>- **Dojo**:
  A place for sparring.

- **Street**:
  A place for concentration.</code></pre>
<p>A tagged list is a list of tag/body pairs. Tagged lists are used
idiomatically in manpages for argument lists but can be used for other
content.</p>
<p>When rendered to mdoc, a tagged list produces a tagged list using the
<code>Bl</code> macro with the arguments <code>-tag</code> and
<code>-width Ds</code>. If the list is ‘tight’ (i.e., there are no blank
lines between elements), the arguments also include
<code>-compact</code>.</p>
