.Sh NAME
.Nm predoc
.Nd a Markdown flavour for man pages
.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
language is a Markdown flavour for writing man pages.
.Pp
This document describes the
.Nm
syntax.
The original source for this man page is written in
.Nm
and can be viewed in the project repository.
.Pp
The command-line utility that can be used to convert
.Nm
into
.Xr mdoc 7
is documented at
.Xr predoc 1 .
.
.Ss Philosophy
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that optimises for
ease-of-reading and ease-of-writing.
As explained on the Markdown project website:
.Bd -ragged -offset 3n
Readability is emphasised above all else.
A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is,
as plain text,
without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting
instructions.
.Ed
.Pp
.Nm
shares this philosophy.
Its syntax is comprised entirely of punctuation characters.
As much as possible,
the punctuation characters are chosen to look like what they
mean.
Headings look like headings,
emphasis looks like emphasis,
lists look like lists and so on.
.Pp
Markdown assumes that it will be converted to HTML.
.Nm
assumes that it will be converted to
.Xr mdoc 7 .
In the same way that Markdown is not a replacement for HTML,
.Nm
is not a replacement for
.Xr mdoc 7 .
John Gruber,
the creator of Markdown,
makes a distinction between HTML as a publishing format and
Markdown as a writing format.
.Nm
makes this same distinction:
.Xr mdoc 7
is a publishing format and
.Nm
is a writing format.
.
.Ss Design Goals
The design goals of
.Nm
are:
.Pp
.Bl -enum -offset 3n -compact
.It
to make the experience of writing man pages pleasant
.It
to convert to semantically significant
.Xr mdoc 7
.It
to degrade gracefully when parsed as Markdown
.El
.Pp
We believe that man pages are an under-utilised resource in the
computing world and that one of the reasons for this is that
.Xr roff 7
and
.Xr mdoc 7
are not approachable formats for writing.
.Pp
The ultimate aim of
.Nm
is to encourage more people to contribute to the production
of man pages.
.
.Sh STRUCTURE
A
.Nm
document should begin with frontmatter followed by a number
of sections.
.
.Ss Frontmatter
Frontmatter is a collection of colon-separated (\c
.Ql ": " )
key-value pairs at the beginning of a
.Nm
document.
Frontmatter is demarcated by 3 or more
.Ql "-"
characters at the beginning and the end.
.Pp
To produce a valid man page,
the frontmatter must include a
.Ar Title .
The other elements are optional.
.Bd -literal -offset indent

.Ed
.Pp
The recognised keys are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo
.Ar Title
.Xc
A word written in capital letters followed by a number in parentheses.
This number corresponds to the manual section number.
See the listing for the
.Ar \&Dt
macro in
.Xr mdoc 7
for more information on the manual sections into which man pages
are categorised.
.It Xo
.Ar Authors
.Xc
A comma-delimited list (\c
.Ql ", " ) .
An author consists of a name followed by an optional e-mail
address in angle brackets.
.It Xo
.Ar Date
.Xc
A combination of day,
month and year.
There are three valid formats for dates:
.Pp
.Bl -enum -offset 3n -compact
.It
.Ql "%Y-%m-%d"
.It
.Ql "%d %B %Y"
.It
.Ql "%B %d, %Y"
.El
.Pp
The format specifiers have the same meaning as
.Xr strftime 3 .
.Xr mdoc 7
man pages use dates in the format
.Ql "%B %d, %Y"
and the date will be converted to this format by
.Xr predoc 1 .
.It Xo
.Ar Project
.Xc
The name of the project.
.Xr mdoc 7
man pages can include an
.Ql "\&.Os"
macro in the prologue.
When rendered to
.Xr mdoc 7 ,
.Xr man 1
typically prints a value at the bottom of the man page.
.Xr predoc 1
will use this value together with
.Ar Version
as an argument to
.Ql "\&.Os" .
.It Xo
.Ar Version
.Xc
The version of the project.
.Xr mdoc 7
man pages can include an
.Ql "\&.Os"
macro in the prologue.
When rendered to
.Xr mdoc 7 ,

.Ss Sections
Sections in a
.Nm
document are created by the use of
.Em Section Headings .
.Pp
The sections typically used in a
.Nm
document are a combination of the following:

.Pp
The first section must be the NAME section and a valid man page
must contain a NAME section.
The NAME section should include at least one instance of the
name of the subject of the man page followed by a description.
.Pp
By convention,
most man pages should also include SYNOPSIS and DESCRIPTION
sections.
As with
.Xr mdoc 7
documents,
the sections in a
.Nm
document are usually ordered as they appear above.
Additional sections can be added where appropriate.

.
.Sh SYNTAX OVERVIEW
.Nm
is a flavour of Markdown and its syntax is a reduced and modified
set of Markdown’s syntax.
Like Markdown,
this syntax consists of:
.Pp
.Bl -enum -offset 3n -compact
.It
block elements
.It
inline elements
.El
.Pp
These elements are discussed in greater detail below in
.Sx "BLOCK ELEMENTS"
and
.Sx "INLINE ELEMENTS" .
.
.Ss Differences to Markdown
While much of syntax will be familiar to users of Markdown,
.Nm
does make two kinds of changes.
First,
it varies the semantic meaning of some elements (referred to
as ‘variations’).
Second,
it adds new elements (referred to as ‘extensions’).
Where a piece of syntax involves a variation or an extension,
it is noted below in the relevant syntax description.
.Pp
Block-level extensions are denoted by
.Sy Predoc block markers .
A Predoc block marker is a series of 3 consecutive backticks
(\c
.Ql "```" )
on a line that open and close the block.
This marker was chosen deliberately because it is recognised
in Markdown as a fenced code block.
Its use in
.Nm
ensures that these extensions degrade gracefully when parsed
by Markdown parsers.
A consequence of this decision is that
.Nm
fenced code blocks are denoted by 4 backticks on a line.
.Pp
Inline-level extensions are denoted by
.Sy Predoc inline markers .
A Predoc inline marker is a single backtick (\c
.Ql "`" )
on either side of an inline element.
As with the block markers,
the inline marker has been chosen deliberately because it degrades
gracefully and,
as a consequence,
raw text is denoted by 2 backticks.
.
.Sh BLOCK ELEMENTS
Block elements are elements that do not need a containing element.
Some block elements can be nested and some cannot.
Each syntax description below notes when a block element can
be nested.
A block element can never be nested inside an inline element.
.
.Ss Blockquotes
A blockquote is denoted by a leading
.Ql "> " .
.Bd -literal -offset indent
> Welcome to the desert
> of the real\&.
.Ed
.Pp
A blockquote can be nested in a blockquote or a list.
A blockquote can contain a blockquote,
code block,
list or simple table.
.Pp
When rendered to
.Xr mdoc 7 ,
a blockquote produces an indented display block using the
.Ql "Bd"
macro with the arguments
.Ql "-ragged"
and
.Ql "-offset 3n" .
.
.Ss Code Blocks
A code block is denoted by an opening ‘fence’ of 4 backticks
(\c
.Ql "````" )
and a closing fence of 4 backticks.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
````
Call trans opt: received\&. 2-19-98 13:24:18 REC:Log>
````
.Ed
.Pp
Code blocks can be nested inside blockquotes and lists.
Code blocks cannot contain other block elements.
If a code block is indented/quoted,
the indent/quote is removed from each line of the code block.
.Pp
This is a
.Em variation
to Markdown.
First,
fences require 4 backticks rather than 3.
Second,
the use of 4 spaces to denote a code block by indentation is
not supported.
.Pp
When rendered to
.Xr mdoc 7 ,
a code block produces an indented display block using the
.Ql "Bd"
macro with the arguments
.Ql "-literal"
and
.Ql "-offset indent" .
.
.Ss Headings
A heading is denoted by the use of 3 or more heading markers
after a line of text.
There are 2 heading markers:
.Ql "="
and
.Ql "-" .
The first denotes a section heading.
The second denotes a subsection heading.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
LOCATIONS
=========

Nebuchadnezzar
--------------
.Ed
.Pp
A heading can be nested in a blockquote.
A heading cannot contain other block elements.
.Pp
This is a
.Em variation
on Markdown.
The use of
.Ql "#"
to denote atx-style headings is not supported.
.Pp
When rendered to
.Xr mdoc 7 ,
a heading produces either a section heading using the
.Ql "Sh"
macro or a subsection heading using the
.Ql "Ss"
macro.
.
.Ss Lists (Indented)
An indented list is denoted by a
.Ql "- "
at the start of the first line,
a
.Ql " -"
at the end of the first line and then a body beginning on the
second line.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
- __Simulacra__ -
  Simulacra are copies that depict things that
  either had no original, or that no longer have
  an original\&.

- __Simulation__ -
  Simulation is the imitation of the operation of
  a real-world process or system over time\&.
.Ed
.Pp
An indented list can be nested in a blockquote or a list.
The list item can contain a blockquote,
code block,
list or simple table.
.Pp
This is a
.Em variation
on Markdown.
An indented list is a list of heading/body pairs.
By indenting the text,
it is intended to be used to express conceptual hierarchy in
the document in a visual way.
.Pp
When rendered to
.Xr mdoc 7 ,
an indented list produces a list using the
.Ql "Bl"
macro with the arguments
.Ql "-hang"
and
.Ql "-offset Ds" .
If the list is ‘tight’ (i.e.,
there are no blank lines between elements),
the arguments also include
.Ql "-compact" .
.
.Ss Lists (Ordered)
An ordered list is denoted by a number followed by a full stop/period
and a space.
The actual number used is not significant.
The list items will be sequentially numbered when read by
.Xr man 1 .
.Bd -literal -offset indent
1\&. Mouse
2\&. Apoc
3\&. Switch
.Ed
.Pp
An ordered list can be nested in a blockquote or a list.
An ordered list item can contain a blockquote,
code block,
list or simple table.
.Pp
When rendered to
.Xr mdoc 7 ,
an ordered list produces a numbered list using the
.Ql "Bl"
macro with the arguments
.Ql "-enum"
and
.Ql "-offset 3n" .
If the list is ‘tight’ (i.e.,
there are no blank lines between elements),
the arguments also include
.Ql "-compact" .
.
.Ss Lists (Tagged)
A tagged list is denoted by a
.Ql "-"
at the start of the first line,
a
.Ql ":"
at the end of the first line and then a body beginning on the
second line.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
- **Dojo**:
  A place for sparring\&.

- **Street**:
  A place for concentration\&.
.Ed
.Pp
A tagged list can be nested in a blockquote or a list.
The list item can contain a blockquote,
code block,
list or simple table.
.Pp
This is a
.Em variation
on Markdown.
A tagged list is a list of tag/body pairs.
Tagged lists are used idiomatically in man pages for argument
lists but can be used for other content.
.Pp
When rendered to
.Xr mdoc 7 ,
a tagged list produces a tagged list using the
.Ql "Bl"
macro with the arguments
.Ql "-tag"
and
.Ql "-width Ds" .
If the list is ‘tight’ (i.e.,
there are no blank lines between elements),
the arguments also include
.Ql "-compact" .
.
.Ss Lists (Unordered)
An unordered list is denoted by a line beginning with
.Ql "- "
or
.Ql "* " .
.Bd -literal -offset indent
- phone
- sunglasses
- jacket
.Ed
.Pp
An unordered list can be nested in a blockquote or a list.
A list item can contain a blockquote,
code block,
list or simple table.
.Pp
This is a
.Em variation
on Markdown.
The use of
.Ql "+"
to mark an unordered list item is not supported to simplify
parsing.
.Pp
When rendered to
.Xr mdoc 7 ,
an unordered list produces a bulleted list using the
.Ql "Bl"
macro with the arguments
.Ql "-bullet"
and
.Ql "-offset 3n" .
If the list is ‘tight’ (i.e.,
there are no blank lines between elements),
the arguments also include
.Ql "-compact" .
.
.Ss Literal mdoc
Literal mdoc is denoted by a Predoc block marker.
The first line must begin with a
.Ql "\&." .
.Bd -literal -offset indent
```
\&.\e\(dq <Train sound>
That is the sound of
\&.Sy inevitability \&.
```
.Ed
.Pp
Literal mdoc can be nested inside blockquotes and lists.
Literal mdoc cannot contain other block elements.
If literal mdoc is indented/quoted,
the indent/quote is removed from each line of the literal mdoc.
.Pp
This is an
.Em extension
to Markdown.
Literal mdoc provides an escape hatch for Predoc in a similar
way to how literal HTML is permitted in Markdown.
While the example above shows a potential use of literal mdoc
to be comments,
in order to add a licence comment to the beginning of a document,
use the
.Ar License
key in the frontmatter (see
.Sx "Frontmatter" ) .
.Pp
When rendered to
.Xr mdoc 7 ,
literal mdoc is passed straight through.
.
.Ss Simple Tables
A simple table is denoted by a Predoc block marker and then 3
or more
.Ql "|"
and
.Ql "-"
characters.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
```
--------|---
 pills  | 2
 spoons | 0
--------|---
```
.Ed
.Pp
A simple table an be nested in a blockquote or a list.
Other blocks cannot be nested inside a table.
.Pp
This is an
.Em extension
to Markdown.
Simple tables are for tabular data.
They do not support headers,
alignment,
column-spanning cells or other fancy features.
For empty cells,
the content can be the
.Ql "\e"
character.
.Pp
When rendered to
.Xr mdoc 7 ,
a simple table produces a columnated list using the
.Ql "Bl"
macro with the argument
.Ql "-column" .
The width of each column will be set to avoid wrapping.
.
.Ss Paragraphs
Paragraphs are the default block element and are not denoted
by any syntax.
.Pp
Paragraphs can be nested in a blockquote or a list.
A paragraph cannot contain other block elements.
.Pp
When rendered to
.Xr mdoc 7 ,
a paragraph produces a sequence of text lines and input lines.
The text lines end on closing delimiters.
.
.Sh Inline Elements
Inline elements are elements that exist within a block element.
Some inline elements can be nested and some cannot.
Each syntax description below notes when an inline element can
be nested.
.
.Ss Arguments (Modifiers)
A modifier is denoted by
.Ql "***"
on either side of text.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
All I see is ***blonde***, ***brunette**, ***redhead***\&.
.Ed
.Pp
A modifier cannot be nested in other inline elements.
A modifier cannot contain other inline elements.
.Pp
This is a
.Em variation
on Markdown.
Modifiers are intended to be used for what
.Xr mdoc 7
calls command modifiers.
This is typically fixed text that is provided as a parameter
to the command.
.
.Ss Arguments (Optionals)
An optional is denoted by
.Ql "\(lB"
and
.Ql "\(rB"
enclosing arguments and/or options.
An optional will only be parsed if its contents are some combination
of arguments,
options and the tokens
.Ql "\&.\&.\&."
and
.Ql "|" .
.Bd -literal -offset indent
Begin the training program using **train**
\(lB**--coop** | **--location** _location_\(rB\&.
.Ed
.Pp
An optional cannot be nested in other inline elements.
An optional cannot contain other inline elements.
.Pp
This is an
.Em extension
to Markdown.
Optionals are intended to be used when an argument or option
is not required to call a command.
.Pp
When rendered to
.Xr mdoc 7 ,
an optional produces an optional part of the command line using
the
.Ql "Oo"
and
.Ql "Oc"
macros.
.
.Ss Arguments (Options)
An option is denoted by
.Ql "**"
on either side of text.
The option name must begin with
.Ql "-" .

.Ql "--" .
.Bd -literal -offset indent
If flying is enabled, use **-f** or **--fly**\&.
.Ed
.Pp
An option cannot be nested in other inline elements.
An option cannot contain other inline elements.
.Pp
This is a
.Em variation
on Markdown.
Options are intended to be used for what
.Xr mdoc 7
calls command-line flags or command-line options.
For strong text,
use the
.Ql "__" .
.Pp
When rendered to
.Xr mdoc 7 ,
an option produces a command option using the
.Ql "Op"
macro.
.
.Ss Arguments (Parameters)
A parameter is denoted by
.Ql "_"
on either side of the text.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
It\(aqs the _question_ that drives us\&.
.Ed
.Pp
A parameter cannot be nested in other inline elements.
A paramater cannot contain other inline elements.
.Pp
This is a
.Em variation
on Markdown.
Parameters are intended to be used for what
.Xr mdoc 7
calls ‘command arguments’ (some people may refer to these
as ‘command-line parameters’ to distinguish from ‘command-line
options’).
For emphasis text,
use
.Ql "*" .
.Pp
When rendered to
.Xr mdoc 7 ,
a parameter produces a command argument using the
.Ql "Ar"
macro.
.
.Ss Automatic Links
An automatic link is denoted by a URL surrounded by angle brackets.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
It means buckle your <http://example\&.org>, Dorothy\&.
.Ed
.Pp

.Pp
A command cannot be nested in other inline elements.
A command cannot contain other inline elements.
.Pp
This is a
.Em variation
on Markdown.
Commands are intended to be used for internal or interactive
commands associated with the subject of the man page.
For strong text,
use
.Ql "__"
instead.
.Pp
When rendered to
.Xr mdoc 7 ,
a command usually produces an internal command using the
.Ql "Ic"
macro.
The exception to this is if the command matches the program
name provided to
.Xr predoc 1 .
In this case,
a command produces the name of the man page using the
.Ql "Nm"
macro.
.
.Ss Cross-References (External)
An external cross-reference is denoted by a Predoc inline marker
on either side of the text.
The text must end in a number in parentheses.

.Pp
When rendered to
.Xr mdoc 7 ,
an external cross-reference produces a cross-reference to another
manual page using the
.Ql "Xr"
macro.
.
.Ss Cross-References (Internal)

.Ed
.Pp
Emphasis text can be nested in links and strong text.
Emphasis text can contain links and strong text.
.Pp
This is a
.Em variation
on Markdown.
The use of
.Ql "_"
is reserved for arguments (parameters)
and does not produce emphasis text.
For command arguments,
use
.Ql "_" .
.Pp
When rendered to
.Xr mdoc 7 ,
emphasis text produces text in an italic font using the
.Ql "Em"
macro.
