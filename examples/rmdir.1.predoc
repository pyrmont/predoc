NAME
====

**rmdir** - remove directories

SYNOPSIS
========

**rmdir** [**-pv**] _directory_ ...

DESCRIPTION
===========

The **rmdir** utility removes the directory entry specified by each _directory_
argument, provided it is empty.

Arguments are processed in the order given. In order to remove both a parent
directory and a subdirectory of that parent, the subdirectory must be specified
first so the parent directory is empty when **rmdir** tries to remove it.

The following options are available:

- **-p**:
  Each _directory_ argument is treated as a pathname of which all components
  will be removed, if they are empty, starting with the last most component.
  (See `rm(1)` for fully non-discriminant recursive removal.)

- **-v**:
  Be verbose, listing each directory as it is removed.

EXIT STATUS
===========

The **rmdir** utility exits with one of the following values:

- 0:
  Each directory entry specified by a _directory_ operand referred to an empty
  directory and was removed successfully.

- >0:
  An error occurred.

EXAMPLES
========

Remove the directory _foobar_, if it is empty:

````
$ rmdir foobar
````

Remove all directories up to and including _cow_, stopping at the first
non-empty directory (if any):

````
$ rmdir -p cow/horse/monkey
````

SEE ALSO
========

`rm(1)`

STANDARDS
=========

The **rmdir** utility is expected to be IEEE Std 1003.2 ("POSIX.2") compatible.

HISTORY
=======

A **rmdir** command appeared in VersionÂ 1 AT&T UNIX.
